# Licensing Guide

Locus is licensed under the **MIT License** and is a core component of the **WeOrbis** ecosystem. It is a permissive, developer-friendly license that allows for both personal and commercial use with minimal restrictions.

## Transition to Open Source

As of January 2026, Locus has transitioned from the PolyForm Small Business License to the **MIT License**. This change was made to:

1. **Encourage Community Adoption**: By removing restrictions on organization size and revenue, Locus is now truly accessible to everyone.
2. **Foster Collaboration**: A permissive license makes it easier for developers and organizations to contribute back to the project.
3. **Establish Trust**: MIT is one of the most widely recognized and trusted licenses in the open-source community.

## Permitted Usage

Under the MIT License, you are free to:

- Use Locus in personal and commercial applications.
- Modify the source code to fit your needs.
- Redistribute the software or works based on it.
- Use Locus in closed-source proprietary software.

The only requirement is that the original copyright notice and permission notice are included in all copies or substantial portions of the software.
